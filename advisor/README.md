# Advisor Skill

A brutally honest advisor that challenges you to think with **ownership, altitude, and outcome-focus**. Based on Vasant's leadership philosophy.

## What This Skill Does

The Advisor helps you:
- ✅ **Stop seeking permission** and start driving outcomes
- ✅ **Elevate your thinking** from tasks → outcomes → business impact
- ✅ **Craft strategic questions** that get real help (not approval)
- ✅ **Set ambitious goals** (think: 10x resources)
- ✅ **Make managers partners**, not approvers
- ✅ **Own your fate** instead of waiting for direction

## Core Philosophy

**You work for Microsoft, not your manager.**

Your manager is paid to **enable your success**, not approve it.

**Ask for help, not permission.**

If this was your company, what would you do? Do that.

## How to Use

### Basic Invocation

```
/advisor
```

The advisor will ask you what you're working on:
1. 📝 Review my communication/plan
2. 🤔 Help me with a decision
3. 🎯 Challenge my goal/strategy
4. 🔄 I'm feeling stuck/uncertain
5. ❓ Help me ask the right questions

### Modes

**Quick Mode (Default):**
- Fast, brutal feedback
- Red flag detection
- Quiz → Feedback → Reframe → Action
- Get unstuck quickly

**Deep Mode:**
```
/advisor deep
```
- Full Socratic dialogue
- Keeps asking "why" until breakthrough
- More confrontational
- Use when you're really stuck

## What to Expect

### The Advisor Will:
- ❌ **NOT validate you to be nice**
- ❌ **NOT agree just to move forward**
- ✅ **Call out low-altitude thinking immediately**
- ✅ **Challenge your assumptions aggressively**
- ✅ **Track patterns and call out repeats**
- ✅ **Push you to think 10x bigger**
- ✅ **Force you to own decisions**

### Tone: Brutal Honesty

Think Vasant's direct feedback:
- *"This already tells me you are setting a very low bar"*
- *"That puts you in a lower position"*
- *"These are activities, not outcomes"*

This isn't about being mean - it's about cutting through noise and pushing you to be the strategic PM you are.

## Use Cases

### 1. Before Sending Important Emails

**Problem:** About to send email asking "Is it okay if I..."

**Advisor helps:**
- Detects permission-seeking language
- Reframes to outcome-driven communication
- Helps craft strategic questions for real help

**Example:**
```
From: "Can I continue with the dashboard project?"
To: "I'm driving deployment confidence. Here's the outcome I'm
targeting and where I need your help..."
```

### 2. Setting Goals/OKRs

**Problem:** Goals are all tasks: "Set up dashboard", "Write docs"

**Advisor helps:**
- Identifies low-altitude (task vs outcome)
- Challenges to think 10x bigger
- Focuses on business impact

**Example:**
```
From: "Q2 Goal: Set up feedback dashboard"
To: "Q2 Outcome: Enable 90% confidence in feature success before
shipping by unifying feedback signals across sovereign clouds"
```

### 3. Crafting Questions to Manager

**Problem:** Not sure what to ask, or asking wrong questions

**Advisor helps:**
- Tests if question is strategic vs permission-seeking
- Provides question templates
- Ensures you're asking for help, not approval

**Example:**
```
From: "Should I integrate with OCD?"
To: "I'm leaning toward OCD integration because [logic]. What
organizational dynamics am I missing that would change this?"
```

### 4. When Feeling Stuck/Uncertain

**Problem:** Waiting for direction, not sure what to do next

**Advisor helps:**
- Identifies "waiting mode" mentality
- Pushes to identify opportunities proactively
- Forces ownership of next steps

**Example:**
```
From: "What should I focus on next?"
To: "I've identified [opportunity] based on [signals]. I'm driving
toward [outcome]. Starting with [action] today."
```

## Red Flags the Advisor Catches

### 🔴 Permission-Seeking
- "Can I...", "Should I...", "Is it okay if..."
- Signals: You're treating manager as approver

### 🔴 Validation-Seeking
- Leading with "I've done X, Y, Z" to manager
- Signals: You're trying to impress, not drive outcomes

### 🔴 Low Altitude
- Focusing on tasks instead of outcomes
- Signals: You're thinking like a task executor, not strategic PM

### 🔴 Waiting Mode
- "What should I focus on?", "Waiting for direction"
- Signals: You've abdicated ownership

## Question Crafting Framework

The advisor teaches you to ask **strategic questions** that get real help:

### ✅ Good Questions (Get Help)

**Access:** "Can you introduce me to [person] for [specific reason]?"

**Perspective:** "Here's my logic [A→B→C]. What am I missing based on your experience?"

**Blocker Removal:** "I need [X] to proceed. What's the fastest path?"

**Logic Validation:** "I'm leaning toward [A] because [reason]. What organizational dynamics should I consider?"

### ❌ Bad Questions (Seek Permission)

- "Can I do this?"
- "Is this okay?"
- "What should I focus on?"
- "Do you approve?"

## Pattern Tracking

The advisor tracks your behavior over time and calls out patterns:

- **"⚠️ This is the 3rd time this week you're asking 'Can I...'"**
- **"📊 Pattern detected: You're consistently setting low-bar goals"**
- **"🎯 Growth: Your altitude has improved from last month"**

This helps you become aware of blind spots and build better habits.

## Key Vasant-isms

The advisor frequently references these core principles:

1. **"Act like it's your own company"**
2. **"Your manager is paid to help you, not judge you"**
3. **"Ask for help, not permission"**
4. **"If you had 10 engineers, what would you commit to?"**
5. **"These are activities, not outcomes"**
6. **"That puts you in a lower position"**
7. **"Your fate is in your control"**
8. **"Make them a partner, not an approver"**
9. **"You work for Microsoft, not your manager"**

## Memory & Context

The advisor knows:
- Your role (Senior PM at Microsoft)
- Your manager (Amit - representative of Microsoft)
- Your focus (Sovereign clouds, deployment confidence)
- Previous feedback (Vasant's coaching)
- Your patterns over time

It uses this context to give relevant, personalized feedback.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be honest** - Don't hold back or sanitize what you're thinking
2. **Answer the quiz** - The questions force clarity before solutions
3. **Embrace the challenge** - The tough love is the point
4. **Track patterns** - Notice when the same feedback repeats
5. **Take action** - Don't just learn, implement immediately

## Example Session

```
You: /advisor

Advisor: What are we working on?
1. 📝 Review my communication/plan
2. 🤔 Help me with a decision
3. 🎯 Challenge my goal/strategy
4. 🔄 I'm feeling stuck/uncertain
5. ❓ Help me ask the right questions

You: 1 - Here's my email to Amit:
"Hi Amit, wanted to check if it's okay to continue with the
feedback dashboard project?"

Advisor:
🚨 RED FLAGS:
1. "wanted to check if it's okay" = begging for permission
2. You're treating Amit like he approves your work
3. This screams "I need validation"

You're a Senior PM. Act like it.

❓ QUIZ - Answer first:
1. What OUTCOME are you driving?
2. Why does it matter to Microsoft?
3. What help do you ACTUALLY need from Amit?

You: [answers]

Advisor:
💪 REFRAME:
"Hi Amit,

I'm driving deployment confidence for sovereign clouds. Goal: 90%
confidence in feature success before shipping.

Next 6 months: [outcomes]

Where I need your help:
- Which leadership forum for buy-in?
- Can you connect me with OCD lead?

Open to redirecting if you see higher leverage.

Victor"

✅ NOW: Send this version. When?

You: Sending today.

Advisor: Good. Stop asking for permission. Start driving outcomes. 💪
```

## When to Use

**Use the advisor when:**
- ✅ Before sending important communications
- ✅ Setting goals or planning quarters
- ✅ Making strategic decisions
- ✅ Feeling stuck or uncertain
- ✅ Wanting to level up your thinking
- ✅ Noticing you're in "waiting mode"

**Don't need the advisor for:**
- ❌ Simple tactical decisions (just decide and act)
- ❌ Technical implementation questions
- ❌ Pure information gathering

## Philosophy in Action

### Old Way (Pre-Advisor)
- "Can I work on the dashboard?" (permission)
- "I completed 3 tasks this week" (validation)
- "What should I focus on?" (waiting)
- "Is this approach okay?" (approval)

### New Way (Post-Advisor)
- "I'm driving this outcome. Here's why it matters. Where do you see gaps in my logic?" (partnership)
- "Next 6 months: [ambitious outcomes]. If you had 10 engineers, you'd do this in 3 months - that's my bar." (ownership)
- "I've identified this opportunity. Starting today." (action)
- "I need your help connecting me with [person] for [specific reason]." (strategic ask)

## Success Metrics

You'll know it's working when:
- ✅ You stop asking "Can I..." and start stating "I'm going to..."
- ✅ Your goals shift from tasks to business outcomes
- ✅ Managers start treating you as a peer/partner
- ✅ You feel in control of your direction
- ✅ You get better help because you ask better questions

## Remember

**The advisor is tough because growth requires challenge.**

You don't need validation. You need to drive outcomes.

Your manager doesn't pay you. Microsoft does.

Your fate is in your control.

Now go make impact. 💪
