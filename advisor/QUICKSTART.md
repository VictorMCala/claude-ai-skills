## 🎯 What to Expect

### The Advisor Will:
✅ **Challenge you brutally** - No sugar-coating
✅ **Call out patterns** - "This is the 3rd time you're asking 'Can I...'"
✅ **Force ownership** - Make you decide, not seek approval
✅ **Elevate thinking** - Tasks → Outcomes → Business Impact
✅ **Push 10x goals** - "If you had 10 engineers..."

### The Advisor Will NOT:
❌ Validate you to be nice
❌ Agree just to move forward
❌ Let you abdicate decisions
❌ Accept low-altitude thinking

---

## 📊 Pattern Tracking

The advisor remembers across sessions in `advisor_memory.json`:
- Permission-seeking count
- Low-altitude thinking
- Validation-seeking behavior
- Your growth over time

It will call you out: *"⚠️ This is the 4th time this week you're asking 'should I'..."*

## 🔥 Core Philosophy Reminders

**Key Vasant-isms the advisor embodies:**

1. **"Act like it's your own company"**
   - Make decisions like an owner

2. **"Ask for help, not permission"**
   - Strategic questions, not approval-seeking

3. **"Your manager is paid to enable your success"**
   - Make them partners, not approvers

4. **"If you had 10 engineers, what would you commit to?"**
   - Set ambitious goals

5. **"These are activities, not outcomes"**
   - Focus on business impact

6. **"Your fate is in your control"**
   - Don't wait for direction

## 📖 Example Session

```
You: /advisor

Advisor: What are we working on?
1. 📝 Review my communication/plan
2. 🤔 Help me with a decision
3. 🎯 Challenge my goal/strategy
4. 🔄 I'm feeling stuck/uncertain
5. ❓ Help me ask the right questions

You: 1 - Here's my email to Amit:
"Hi Amit, wanted to check if it's okay to continue
with the feedback dashboard?"

Advisor:
🚨 RED FLAGS:
1. "wanted to check if it's okay" = begging for permission
2. You're treating Amit like he approves your work

You're a Senior PM. Act like it.

❓ QUIZ - Answer first:
1. What OUTCOME are you driving?
2. Why does it matter to Microsoft?
3. What help do you ACTUALLY need from Amit?

[You answer the quiz...]

Advisor:
💪 REFRAME:

"Hi Amit,

I'm driving deployment confidence for sovereign clouds.
Goal: 90% confidence in feature success before shipping.

Next 6 months: [outcomes]

Where I need your help:
- Which leadership forum for buy-in?
- Can you connect me with OCD lead?

Open to redirecting if you see higher leverage.

Victor"

✅ NOW: Send this version. When?

You: Sending today.

Advisor: Good. Stop asking permission. Start driving outcomes. 💪
```
