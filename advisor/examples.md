# Advisor Examples

Real-world examples of how the Advisor transforms thinking from permission-seeking → outcome-driving.

## Example 1: Email to Manager

### ❌ Before (Permission-Seeking)

```
Subject: Question about dashboard project

Hi Amit,

I wanted to check in about the feedback dashboard project I've
been working on. I've made good progress and completed the initial
setup in the test tenant.

Wanted to get your thoughts on whether I should continue focusing
on this or if there are other priorities you'd like me to consider?

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Victor
```

**Problems:**
- "wanted to check in" = seeking validation
- "I've made good progress" = trying to impress
- "whether I should continue" = asking for approval
- "other priorities you'd like me to consider" = waiting for direction
- Entire tone is asking permission

Subject: Driving Deployment Confidence for Sovereign Clouds

Hi Amit,

I'm focused on building deployment confidence for GCC/GCCH. Today
we ship features and hope they work - I want us to ship with 90%
confidence of customer satisfaction.

Next 6 months, I'm driving toward:
1. Unified feedback dashboard across sovereign clouds (visibility)
2. Feedback → ICM integration (closed-loop improvements)
3. Proactive detection via offline event integration (catch issues
   pre-deployment)

This matters because it directly impacts customer satisfaction and
reduces firefighting for the team.

Where I need your help:
- Which leadership forum should I present in to secure buy-in?
- Can you introduce me to the OCD platform team lead? I need their
  input on feedback integration architecture.
- What organizational dynamics between our team and OCD should I
  be aware of?

I'm open to redirecting if you see higher-leverage opportunities
from your altitude.

Starting execution this week.

Victor
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Leads with outcome, not activities
- ✅ States clear business impact
- ✅ Specific asks for help (not approval)
- ✅ Makes Amit a partner, not approver
- ✅ Shows ownership and action orientation
- ✅ Open to input but driving the direction

---

## Example 2: Goal Setting

### ❌ Before (Task-Level)

```
My Q2 Goals:

1. Set up feedback dashboard for GCC
2. Create documentation for sovereign cloud features
3. Run 3 customer feedback experiments
4. Meet with 5 stakeholder teams
5. Complete OCD integration research
```

**Problems:**
- All activities, no outcomes
- No business impact stated
- Low ambition (could be done in 2 weeks)
- Reads like a to-do list
- No clear "why"

---

### ✅ After (Outcome-Level)

```
My Q2 Outcome:

Enable the team to ship sovereign cloud features with 90%
confidence of customer satisfaction.

Success looks like:
- Product managers can predict feature success before launch
- Customer feedback drives automated improvement loops
- Issues are caught in pre-production, not after deployment

Key Results:
1. Unified feedback visibility across GCC/GCCH/DoD (70% coverage)
2. 20+ feedback-driven ICMs filed and resolved
3. Offline event integration preventing 3+ customer issues
4. Dashboard adopted by 3+ PM teams for decision-making

Why this matters:
- Reduces customer pain from bad deployments
- Cuts firefighting time by 50%
- Builds systematic quality culture

Timeline: 6 months (thinking 10x: if I had 10 engineers, I'd
commit to 3 months)

Current progress validates feasibility: Already enabled in test
tenant, positive signals from OCD team.
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Clear outcome stated upfront
- ✅ Measurable impact
- ✅ Business value explicit
- ✅ Ambitious scope (6 months, but acknowledged 10x thinking)
- ✅ Evidence of feasibility
- ✅ Paints picture of success

---

## Example 3: Asking for Help (Strategic Questions)

### ❌ Before (Vague/Permission-Seeking)

```
Hi Amit,

I'm not sure if I should integrate with OCD or build our own
solution for the feedback system. What do you think I should do?

Also, can you help me figure out who I should talk to about this?

Let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,
Victor
```

**Problems:**
- Asking Amit to make the decision
- Vague asks ("help me figure out", "let me know your thoughts")
- Can find people himself (Copilot, org chart)
- Abdicating ownership

---

### ✅ After (Strategic Questions)

```
Hi Amit,

I'm evaluating OCD vs custom solution for feedback integration.

My logic: OCD gives us faster time-to-value (existing platform,
team support) but may have limitations on sovereign cloud data
handling. Custom gives us full control but 3x development time.

I'm leaning toward OCD integration for speed, with custom
analytics layer on top for sovereign-specific needs.

Where I need your perspective:
1. What are the political/organizational dynamics between our team
   and OCD I should consider?
2. Has there been a previous attempt to integrate with OCD in
   sovereign clouds? What happened? Who has the history?
3. If I go custom, what approval gates should I expect for new
   infrastructure in sovereign environments?

Based on your experience, what critical factors am I not weighing?

Victor
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Shows clear thinking/logic
- ✅ States position (but open to input)
- ✅ Specific questions leveraging Amit's altitude
- ✅ Asks for perspective, not decision
- ✅ Questions only Amit can answer (not self-service)
- ✅ Keeps ownership with Victor

## Example 4: Status Update

### ❌ Before (Validation-Seeking)

```
Weekly Update

Hi Amit,

This week I:
- Completed dashboard setup in test tenant ✅
- Met with 3 stakeholders ✅
- Reviewed OCD documentation ✅
- Created initial design doc ✅

Making good progress! Let me know if you have any feedback.

Victor
```

**Problems:**
- Reads like homework submission
- Seeking validation (checkmarks, "making good progress")
- All activities, no impact
- "Let me know if you have any feedback" = seeking approval
- Puts Amit in judge role

---

### ✅ After (Impact-Focused)

```
Deployment Confidence Update

Progress on 6-month outcome (90% confidence in feature success):

Impact this week:
- Unified dashboard now surfaces GCC vs Worldwide gaps → identified
  3 Outlook integration issues to escalate
- OCD team confirmed feasibility of feedback integration →
  unblocked path forward
- Test tenant validation shows 2x faster issue detection vs manual
  process

Next: Filing 3 ICMs this week based on dashboard insights (driving
actual product improvements).

Blocker: Need introduction to Outlook team lead to escalate the 3
issues found. Can you connect us?

Victor
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Leads with outcome context
- ✅ Focuses on impact, not activities
- ✅ Shows business value ("2x faster detection")
- ✅ Forward-looking ("Next:")
- ✅ Specific ask to unblock ("Blocker:")
- ✅ No validation-seeking language

---

## Example 5: Decision-Making

### ❌ Before (Seeking Approval)

```
Hi Amit,

I have a decision to make about whether to present our feedback
work in the monthly PM forum or wait for the quarterly business
review.

What do you think I should do? Should I wait or go now?

Thanks,
Victor
```

**Problems:**
- Asking Amit to make a simple decision
- Victor can and should decide this
- No context on why it matters
- Completely abdicating ownership

---

### ✅ After (Making the Decision)

```
Hi Amit,

Heads up: I'm presenting deployment confidence work in tomorrow's
PM forum.

Rationale: Monthly PM forum has the right audience (PMs who will
use the dashboard) and creates urgency. QBR is too far out and
wrong audience (leadership vs users).

If you see a reason to wait, let me know by EOD, otherwise I'm
going ahead.

Victor
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ States the decision made
- ✅ Provides rationale (shows thinking)
- ✅ Keeps ownership
- ✅ Opens door for input (but moving forward)
- ✅ Time-bound ("by EOD")
- ✅ Default action is to proceed

---

## Example 6: Being Stuck

### ❌ Before (Waiting Mode)

```
Hi Amit,

I've finished the initial dashboard work and I'm not sure what to
focus on next. What should my priorities be for the next few weeks?

Can we schedule some time to discuss direction?

Thanks,
Victor
```

**Problems:**
- Complete waiting mode
- Expecting Amit to set priorities
- No proactive thinking
- Abdicating ownership of direction

---

### ✅ After (Driving Direction)

```
Hi Amit,

Dashboard v1 is live. Based on signals, I see 3 high-leverage
opportunities:

1. Feedback → ICM integration (closes the improvement loop)
2. Telemetry correlation (richer context for feedback)
3. Expansion to GCCH/DoD (scale impact)

I'm prioritizing #1 (ICM integration) because:
- Highest impact (turns feedback into actual improvements)
- Unblocks team's biggest pain (manual ICM filing)
- Fastest to deliver (OCD has APIs ready)

Starting this week. #2 and #3 follow.

If you see a higher-leverage path from your altitude, I'm open to
redirecting. Otherwise, proceeding with ICM integration.

Victor
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Identified opportunities proactively
- ✅ Made prioritization decision with clear logic
- ✅ Taking action ("Starting this week")
- ✅ Open to input but not waiting
- ✅ Default is to proceed
- ✅ Shows strategic thinking

---

## Example 7: Asking for Introduction

### ❌ Before (Lazy Ask)

```
Hi Amit,

Can you help me connect with people in the OCD team?

Thanks,
Victor
```

**Problems:**
- Too vague
- Can find people himself
- No specific reason given
- Wastes Amit's time

---

### ✅ After (Strategic Connection)

```
Hi Amit,

Can you introduce me to the OCD platform team lead?

I need their input on feedback API architecture - specifically
around sovereign cloud data handling requirements and offline
event integration patterns.

Goal: Align on technical approach before I build, avoid rework.

Happy to send intro email if that's easier.

Victor
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ Specific person (role)
- ✅ Clear purpose
- ✅ Shows respect for Amit's time
- ✅ Offers to make it easy (draft intro)
- ✅ Good use of Amit's network access

## Pattern Evolution

Watch how Victor's patterns change over time:

### Month 1: Heavy Permission-Seeking
- "Can I...", "Should I...", "Is it okay..."
- Advisor calls it out aggressively
- Victor becomes aware of the pattern

### Month 2: Transitioning
- "I'm planning to... What do you think?"
- Still seeking validation but improving
- Advisor: "Better, but you don't need validation"

### Month 3: Ownership
- "I'm doing X because Y. If you see gaps in my logic..."
- Clear ownership, open to input
- Advisor: "✅ This is partnership"

### Month 4: Full Ownership
- "Here's what I'm driving. Here's where I need your help."
- Complete ownership, strategic asks
- Advisor: "💪 This is the way"

---

## Quick Reference: Language Shifts

| ❌ Old Way | ✅ New Way |
|-----------|-----------|
| "Can I do this?" | "I'm doing this because..." |
| "Should I focus on X?" | "I'm focusing on X because..." |
| "Is this okay?" | "Here's my logic. What am I missing?" |
| "What do you think?" | "What's your perspective on [specific aspect]?" |
| "I completed X, Y, Z" | "Impact: [outcome achieved]" |
| "Let me know if..." | "Unless you see [specific issue], proceeding" |
| "Wanted to check in" | "Here's progress on [outcome]" |
| "What should I prioritize?" | "I'm prioritizing X because Y" |
| "Can you help me with..." | "Can you [specific ask] so I can [specific outcome]?" |
| "Waiting for direction" | "I've identified [opportunity], starting [action]" |

---

## Remember

**Every interaction is practice:**
- Practice ownership → Build ownership muscle
- Practice outcomes → Think outcomes naturally
- Practice partnership → Change relationship dynamic

**The advisor is your sparring partner.**

Use it before every important communication until the new patterns become automatic.

Then you won't need the advisor anymore - you'll BE the advisor. 💪
