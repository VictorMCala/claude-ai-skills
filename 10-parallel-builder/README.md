# Parallel Builder

Launch 4-5 parallel project explorations with different approaches, then pick the winner.

## Quick Start

Use this skill when:
- Starting a new project
- Uncertain about best approach
- Want to explore options before committing

## The Four Approaches

1. **Brain Dump** - Quick, unstructured idea dump
2. **Structured** - Detailed requirements and specifications
3. **Design-First** - Visual references from Mobbin/Dribbble
4. **Code Template** - Start from existing patterns

## How It Works

1. Launch 4-5 parallel builds (7-10 min each)
2. Compare results
3. Pick the winner
4. Proceed to `/create-plan`

## Time Investment

- **Upfront**: 30 minutes exploring
- **Saved**: 2-4 hours of iteration
